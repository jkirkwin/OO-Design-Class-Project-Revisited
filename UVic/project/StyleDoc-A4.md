# A style document describing the development of our design decisions

## Model

The Model has been largely inherited from assignment two. Using Hub as our Primary EntryPoint, we can access all Devices and UserAccounts in our system. The Model is completely independent and does not rely on anything outside itself. Using Rooms as a bundling object, devices are pooled together so as to alert each other when they need to interact.

### Hub

The Hub is the core of our model. It is responsible for registering and unregistering for all devices and UserAccounts in the system, and for holding aggregations and mappings of all entities currently in the system. It can also access almost any information about the objects it holds. This allows it to stay as the main point of contact for Controller for most functionality.

While the aspiration is for the Hub to be the only thing able to access that which it holds, it became unwieldly to continue that implementation. In an effort to avoid having a God-Class of a hub, we decided to implement getUser() and getDevice() so we could be more flexible in Controller, and separate concerns more effectively.

Hub also acts as a mediator within the model, in that it is the go-between in nearly all communication between other model entities (UserAccounts, Devices, and Rooms primarily). 

#### Notifications

We have added Notifications to our Model to let our System talk to our Users even when they're away. Each UserAccount stores all the notifications from all the devices they're allowed to interact with. Notifications go through hub and into the notification stack of any users that don't have the device in their blacklist. Notifications can be about various things in the model (rooms, devices, users) as well as for generic "plain" notifications that are not tied to any particular model entity. When the Notifications are accessed, they're removed from UserAccount and given to View to be displayed for the User.

We moved the notifications from being stored as JSONMessaging objects (as they were in A2/A3) to being stored as simple JSONObjects. This cut down on storage and complexity by removing all the device references that were stored in the JSONMessaging objects, preventing old device objects from getting garbage collected until all users had cleared their notifications. JSONMessaging.java was repurposed as a utility class for creating notification for the system.

### Rooms

Rooms are Objects which are responsible for knowing which Devices have been assigned to them, which Hub has jurisdiction over it's Devices, and adding/removing these objects from itself. We made the Rooms purposefully detached from a physical concept of a room so that, in actual use, it could apply to groups of Devices linked together for a reason other than that they share the same physical space. 

#### Events

Sometimes events will occur that will require devices talking to each other. Rooms are used to dictate which Devices should be alerted by any other given Device. Rather than having every Lightbulb in the smarthouse turn on when someone steps into the foyer, the house will wait for the camera in the halleay to detect movement before lighting up the next room. Eco-friendly AND convenient!!

### UserAccount

UserAccount is responsible for knowing it's own accessLevel, which Hub it belongs to, it's username and password for verification, and it also holds the blacklist of devices it may not see or recieve notifications from.

We decided to have the UserAccounts store their own accessLevel and Device Blacklist so as to limit complexity of Hub. 

### Device

Device is an Abstract Class that is extended by all devices in the system. It holds the Hub it belongs to, its Label, Status and most importantly its UUID.

We use the UUID to do all important tasks in the system. Every time we want to get or change any device, the UUID is always part of the call. This assures us we can find the specific device we need and that we can't get our deviceTypes confused. 

#### Camera

Camera extends Device and is responsible for keeping track of if it is recording, the diskSize (space currently used) and if it is full or not. It also uses a WebView to stream the camera's Data to the DeviceConfigScreen. The video stream is only active when the Camera is turned on and recording, as per the specs.

#### Thermostat
	
Thermostat extends Device and is responsible for holding the Temperature, and making sure any new Temperatures are within acceptable limits for an average household. It allows conversion between the two commonly used degree systems.

#### Lightbulb & SmartPlug

Lightbulb & SmartPlug extend Device and are responsible for knowing if they are active or not.

### Storage

The Storage sub-package of model is repsonsible for converting all stateful entities within the model into a JSON representation, storing these entities  in a consistent system storage directory (consistency ensured by the storage package itself), recording previous system states in the event that an error occurs and the user would like to roll back the model to the last recorded state, and re-building the model (exactly as it was at shutdown) from the JSON representation.

### Changes from Assignment#3

The Major changes from Assignment 3 are the addition of rooms, and the expansion of storage.

### Model UML

## Controller

Controller is the middle man for View and Model, holding Model's Hub, and View's Client. It also knows who the ActiveUser is and has a Stack of ViewTypes so as to maintain an order of how the current screen was gotten to, facilitating backtracking.
	
It has a Parent Class for many of the controller methods used by multiple View/Controller functionalities, but the majority of the Controller is broken up into sub Controllers. These specialized Controllers greatly improve the loose-coupling of the App as a whole. Each Controller is either Scene specific, handling events or getting info from Model, or function specific, crossing simpler Scene boundaries but filling the same role, each are described below.

### Handlers

For every button in our application we need a method to give it functionality. By and large these live in Controller. We keep the handlers in Controller so as to limit control flow complexity in View. Putting our Handlers here also allows us to keep View and Model separate. As most of our buttons in View require us to access the Model, keeping large parts of the logic here lets us keep coupling loose.

### Public Utility Functions

Not all actions in View require us to access Model. Some only require the manipulation or accessing of things in controller: handleBackClick() or refresh() are examples of this.

Likewise, some functions which do access Model are used by most every ViewBuilder file. These are kept in the Parent Controller for easy of access by any view that normally only has access to one of the sub Controller, keeping complexity and code duplication down.

### FindBuilder

The Heart of Controller is FindBuilder(). This is used to maintain the View Stack for going backwards and also for creating the right screen going forward.

We decided to go with Dynamically generating each screen as we come to it so that:
* a) we don't need to save state anywhere, therein lowering space complexity and app launch overhead.
* b) ensuring that anything displayed at any time will be accurate to the Model's current State.

FindBuilder() was echoed with deviceViewSwitch() to keep it clean code and to find the correct view to build for each Device Config Screen.

### Changes from Assignment#3

The controller re-factor focused on separating all non-universal functions into appropriate modules, and moving each of these functionality bundles into its own class, which extend the Controller class. Necessitated by this modification was a few changes to the interaction between View and Controller. Most Scenes in View have a corresponding Sub-Controller: a class which extends controller and thus contains all necessary public utility functionality as well as all specific use functions relevant to the view in questions. Some views share a specialized controller: For example, the AdminHub and BasicHub client views are both controlled by HubController.

We've also introduced logging. The specs and properties set for the logger can be seen in logging\Logging.java. We elected for a single logger to be used by the entire system for simplicity's sake. Logs are stored indefinitely, and most recent ones are displayed to admins when they log in.

We began implementing a concurrent status check feature, but realized our time would be better spent elsewhere. See controller.threading for what we started out with.

### System UML

## View

### Client

Client is the class in View that serves as the point of contact for Controller. It holds the Stage (window) used to house the GUI.

### SceneBuilder

SceneBuilder and its extensions serve as a simple, concise method to create any necessary view within the Client GUI. It makes use of the Template design pattern, where the buildCommon() method adds all Nodes common to all extensions of the class, while buildSpecifics() adds on the Nodes needed for the specific view being displayed. The build() method packages the results of buildCommon and buildSpecifics into a Scene object and returns this, ready to be displayed by Client. 

#### LoginView

Upon opening the application, the User is greeted by the LogIn screen. From this screen we can create new Accounts, Basic or Admin. We may then press the login button to go to HubView.

#### HubView

The HubView, much like Model's Hub, is the core of the application. It is from here that all other screens originate.

##### Basic

If the User logs in with a Basic UserAccount they are presented with a simple HubView. Consisting of all the Devices they're allowed to see. Selecting any of these will open the Device Config Screen for the specific Device. It is from here you may also turn the house (all Devices) OFF, or access all notifications from the time you've been away (Logged out).

##### Admin

If the User logs in with an Admin UserAccount they are presented with the same simple HubView as a Basic UserAccount, as well as the Admin Panel. Manage Users will let you go see a list of all non-Admin Users and either delete the UserAccount or add/remove devices to/from user Blacklists.

Manage Devices takes the User to a list of Devices in the system. Selecting any of these Devices will delete it from the System. Selecting the New Device Button will take the User to the Create Device screen where a new Device can be created of any available type (Any new DeviceTypes will automatically be added to the list). The Device will be given a default label or a custom one if specified. It can also be created in either the ON or OFF state.

Manage Rooms takes the User to a list of Rooms in the system. From here you can create new Rooms, delete existing Rooms, or add/remove Devices from any given Room.

### DeviceSceneBuilder

The DeviceSceneBuilder class provides the basis for all the Device Config Screens. It is used to construct the basic functions common to all Device Screens. Such as relabeling and turning the device on and off.

#### CameraScene

Camera Scene allows for the Camera to start and stop recording when Device is ON. It also displays how full the diskSpace is. If the disk is full, the camera goes into an errored state. It also displays the video feed for the Camera.

#### ThermostatScene

Thermostat Scene displays current Temperature in the correct DegreeType and can be converted from CELSIUS to FAHRENHEIT and back. New temperatures can be made with either DegreeType but will reject any Temperatures that are out of bounds.

#### Lightbulb & SmartPlug

The remaining Devices only require the basic Device Functionality but have been given their own ViewBuilders for easy of future development. Dimmers or Meters come to mind.

### Changes from Assignment#3

The Biggest changes since last submission are the addition of Manage Rooms, Notifications, and adding Logs to the Admin Panel. With the ability to now Blacklist devices from users and that interaction with Notifications as well as the Room events and Logging, the View portion of A4 was quite cohesive.

## Testing / App launch / Running test suite

### Testing

We have done our best to have our test package structure mimic that of the source code. The storage package has been fully tested, and the UI processes needed for our acceptance tests has been tested for the most part. We have a few basic model tests, and our next step before anything else will be fleshing out our model coverage. Once the controller re-factor is complete, we will move forward with unit tests for that package too, noting that some controller testing has been done via the UI tests found in the view package.

Unfortunately, gradle does not play nicely with two of our model tests (although it runs and passes as expected when run as a JUnit test from within Eclipse). Because of these compatability issues, `gradle test` appears to hang up after a little while. Once this happens go ahead and force end the process with Control+C. Then you'll get the failure report. (PS, @The Marker, if you know why it works in eclipse but not when run from cmd, we would love to know).

We also ran into a snag when combining out UI and model test suites. The setup required for the UI tests affects the storage tests and prevents some of them from running. We decided to work on the source code instead of rectifying this because we did not have time to do both. For ideal results, we have been running the two test suites seperately (which you can do by moving all the view tests to their own folder). In this case, all tests pass as expected.


### How to Launch the app

* From the command line (at least on Jamie's win 10 machine!!) type `gradle run`.
* From eclipse, just run Startup.java as a Java Application.

### How to run the test suite
* (to be safe) type gradle spotlessapply first!
* From the command line (on Jamie's win 10 machine!!) type `gradle test`. 
* From eclipse, run the src/test/java folder as a JUnit test.

### Changes from Assignment#3

Since A3 we've fleshed out our testing of model and gotten good coverage of the UI.
