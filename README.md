The original project that this repo is based on was to create a smart home management 
application for SEng 330 (Object Oriented Design) at UVic. The project was not actually
assigned in earnest until after half way through the semester, and it ended up being 
very educational, but a bit of a hack job. 

I plan to use this repo (an extension of the original, beginning at commit 
bb715113fc5363c20a732eec36be0a5dea173e60) as an oportunity to work on my refactoring 
skills and get some more practice with Java.

The project as assigned was comprised primarily of assignments 3 and 4. The specs for 
these can be found in /UVic/specs/. /UVic/project/ houses some residual documentation 
on the result of our project time.

TODO.md holds a list of tasks I would like to accomplish as part of this process, and changelog.md will house a list of code modifications made.
